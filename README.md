# Daily Dashboard

The **Daily Dashboard** is a PyQt5 application that combines task tracking, a Pomodoro timer and simple note taking into a single window. Data such as tasks, notes and Eisenhower matrix items are stored alongside the code under `DailyDashboard/` so everything stays self contained.

## Installation

The only required dependency is PyQt5. Install it using pip:

```bash
pip install PyQt5
```

Python 3 is assumed to already be available on your system.

## Running the application

From the repository root run:

```bash
python DailyDashboard/main_dashboard.py
```

The dashboard window will open and you can begin organizing your day.
